# Project Title
1.	Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
2.  Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning
3.	Train a Model with Different Optimizers
4.	Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard
## Description

1.Tensor manipulations involve modifying tensors through operations like slicing, concatenation, or transposing. Reshaping changes the structure of a tensor (e.g., converting a 2D matrix to a 1D vector) without altering its data. These operations are essential for preparing data for machine learning tasks.
2.Loss functions measure how well a model's predictions match the actual data, guiding the training process. Hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing settings like learning rate or batch size to improve model performance. Both are critical for building effective machine learning models.
3.This task involves training an MNIST model using two optimizers: Adam and SGD. Adam adapts learning rates for faster convergence, while SGD uses a fixed learning rate. Comparing their performance helps understand optimizer impact on model training.
4.This task involves training a neural network while logging metrics like loss and accuracy to TensorBoard. TensorBoard provides visualizations to monitor and analyze training progress, making it easier to debug and improve the model.
